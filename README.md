# üåê HTML, CSS & JavaScript Online Compiler

This project is a **web-based online compiler** that allows users to write, edit, and run HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code directly in the browser. Built using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it provides an easy and lightweight environment for testing and experimenting with front-end code without the need for any external tools, servers, or APIs.

The compiler consists of three editor panels where users can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript separately. A **preview section** displays the live output of the written code inside an embedded iframe. The interface also includes **Run** and **Clear** buttons for better control. The **Run button** compiles the code and displays the output, while the **Clear button** resets all editors and the preview area. In addition, the editor supports **real-time rendering**, so any change in the code is immediately reflected in the output.

The **user interface** has been designed with simplicity and responsiveness in mind. It uses a **dark-themed editor area**, styled buttons, and a modern layout to give a professional coding environment feel. The grid layout ensures the editors adjust automatically based on screen size, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.

This project is especially useful for beginners learning web development as it eliminates setup complexity and allows direct focus on coding practice. It can also serve as a handy tool for quickly testing small code snippets or sharing demonstrations.
